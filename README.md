# Hello there! I'm Stacey üêæüì±

I'm a software engineer with a deep passion for crafting IoT and Mobile Solutions that bring joy to pets and health to plants. With a background as an EDD/NDD dog handler and trainer, my special focus is on improving the lives of our canine companions. My goal is to make technology more accessible for everyone, all while fostering a greener, happier world.

In my coding adventures, I explore these technologies to power smart, user-friendly solutions. I'm particularly enthusiastic about the React and Flutter ecosystems.

Join me on this journey of innovation and improvement. Let's build a brighter future for our furry friends and green companions, especially our beloved dogs, together!
